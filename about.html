                            Born January 26th, 1993 from a Northern Irish mother and Canadian father in Victoria, British Columbia. A city of approximately 350,000 people it is well known for its quiet atmosphere, gardens, and a places where many come to retire. A short trip just across the water is the  vibrant city of Vancouver where you can experience, in many ways, a completely different atmosphere. For the younger generations Victoria is said to be a bit of a boring place, and while I can agree with that notion, it is no doubt somewhere I could comfortably live my whole life.</p>

                            There's three things I cannot get enough of in life: coffee, alcohol, and video games. Some might say I have an addictive personality, and I would say to those people, you're probably right. Ever since I was young child I was always enticed by games, possibly stemming from my dad's love for them. In fact I remember a picture of myself as an infant sitting on my dad's lap while he sits at the computer playing Command & Conquer. When I got older I undoubtedly loved those series of games. To this day I still have captivating experiences with new games and hope I can enjoy them for a long time to come.</p>

                            When it comes to my other two vices, err-- I mean "favorite beverages", these are more recent likes, as you could imagine. Like many people, coffee and alcohol were definitely acquired tastes and to this day I'm still in the process of attempting to enjoy it all. Unlike alcohol, coffee is a two-part love, drinking AND brewing. Being able to control so many aspects of the flavor through just simple steps is a very satisfying process for me. It's really quite apparent how much power you have when you do mess it up and the result is an awful bitter, or watery cup. As much as I love it, maybe surprisingly, I do tend to only drink one cup a day in the mornings. Only one? Yes, because...</p>

                            It was August of 2016 when I had my first visit to Japan, but it wasn't until two years later in May of 2018 that I had officially moved here. Japan has always been fascinating for me and I think for most westerners, as we are often shown sensationalist headlines of their news and the exposure of "whacky" customs. This goes both ways of course, as not everything shown to Japanese people about western culture is considered normal to actual westerners. Regardless, I was interested in the country and intent on exploring it for myself. To which I should then add, I was not alone nor was exploration my only reason for coming to Japan. My now wife, Hanako, was my partner in crime from the beginning. Originally meeting each other in my hometown of Victoria we had now finally reunited in Japan after 2 years of a long distance relationship.</p>
